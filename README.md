This is my personal portfolio as a beginner web developer.
Included in my portfolio are six links to my projects that I have deployed. 
On the page you will notice that the navigation bar allows for users to click specific locations within 
the portfolio and the page will navigate there upon the click.
My skills are listed as well, along with my contact information.
This portfolio is still growing so keep in touch for updates!
